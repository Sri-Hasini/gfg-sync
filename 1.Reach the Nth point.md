# Reach the Nth point
- [Problem link from Gfg](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reach-the-nth-point5433/1)
## Easy
There are N points on the road, you can step ahead by 1 or 2 . If you start from a point 0, and can only move from point i to point i+1 after taking a step of length one, find the number of ways you can reach at point N. 

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int nthPoint(int n) {
        long long a = 1, b = 1;
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            long long c = (a + b) % 1000000007;
            a = b;
            b = c;
        }
        return (int)b % 1000000007;
    }
};
```
