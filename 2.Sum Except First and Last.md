- [Problem from Gfg](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/max-length-chain/1)
## Basic
You are given an array arr of numbers. Return the sum of all the elements except the first and last elements.
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    /*You are required to complete this method*/
    int sumExceptFirstLast(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) sum += arr[i];
        return sum;
    }
};
```
